#define mMm mind
#define Why Where
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Why imMms my mMm?
Why is my mMm?
Where is my mMm?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
Bump into me, swear he's
Tryin' a talk to me, say wait wait

Why is your mMm?
Why is your mind?
Where is your mind?
Way out in the msu
See it swimming

#undefine Why

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself
#undefine msu
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the msu
See it swimming
